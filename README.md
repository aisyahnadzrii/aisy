## About Me

I'm a bioinformatics student passionate about data science and the intersection of biology and technology. Bioinformatics, for those unfamiliar, is all about leveraging computational methods to analyze and interpret biological data. In my academic journey, I'm delving into the fascinating world of genomics, proteomics, and beyond, using data-driven approaches.

My work involves handling diverse datasets, applying statistical analysis, and developing data pipelines to extract valuable insights. Beyond academia, I'm a proponent of open science and collaboration. When I'm not decoding biological puzzles, you'll find me exploring the outdoors or diving into coding projects. Let's connect and explore the incredible potential of data in bioinformatics.
